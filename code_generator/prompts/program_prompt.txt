# Write a complete Python program named file_manager.py that:
# 1. Recursively traverses a given directory (passed as a CLI argument).
# 2. Identifies files larger than 10 MB and prints their full paths.
# 3. Offers a --delete switch to delete those large files after listing.
# 4. Logs all actions to file_manager.log in the current directory.
# Include all necessary imports and proper error handling.
